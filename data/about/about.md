I’m a software developer with a professional background in the media broadcast industry. I hold a Bachelors of Computer Science (Honours) degree from [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca), Canada. I specialize in web technologies with an emphasis on the front-end . I’m passionate about high-quality engineering and positive user experiences.

A few of my core values:

* **Pragmatism** - Take the practical approach.
* **Long-Term Thinking** - Optimize for long-term benefits (within reason).
* **Open-Mindedness** - Defend good, rational ideas but remain open to new approaches.
* **Continuous Improvement** - No matter the situation, find the learning experience. Strive to always improve.
