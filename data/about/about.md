I’m a software developer with a background in the media broadcast industry. I hold a Bachelors of Computer Science (Honours) degree from Carleton University, Canada. I specialize in web technologies. I’m passionate about high-quality engineering and positive user experiences.

Core values:

* **Pragmatism** - I value taking the practical approach (within reason).
* **Long-Term Thinking** - It's not always wise to rush and implement a quick solution if it impacts the chance of success over a longer period.
* **Open-Mindedness** - One should defend good, rational ideas but always be open to new approaches.
* **Continuous Improvement** - No matter the situation, there's a learning experience to be had; we should always strive to be improving ourselves.
